# Wasmo CLI

# Installation

This project can be installed and compiled from source with this Cargo command:

```
$ cargo install wasmo
or
$ brew tap maif/wasmo
$ brew install wasmo
```

Additionally there are [precompiled artifacts built on CI][artifacts] which are
available for download as well.

[artifacts]: https://github.com/MAIF/wasmo/releases

Installation can be confirmed with:

```
$ wasmo --version
```

Subcommands can be explored with:

```
$ wasmo help
```

# Quick start

``` 
wasmo init --name=my-first-plugin --template=js
wasmo build --host=OneShotDocker --path=my-first-plugin
```

Then open the content of your `my-first-plugin` folder. You should find the generated WASM binary named `my-first-plugin-1.0.0.wasm`.

## Specifying language and product to create a plugin 

With the newer version, you should create a plugin by specifying the language to be used, the target product, and the template.

```
wasmo init --name=my-first-plugin --language=js --product=otoroshi --product_template=ACCESS_CONTROL
```

The product template parameter accepts multiple values: 
  - **REQUEST_TRANSFORMER**: Transform the content of the request with a wasm plugin
  - **RESPONSE_TRANSFORMER**: Transform the content of a response with a wasm plugin
  - **ACCESS_CONTROL**: Delegate route access to a wasm plugin
  - **BACKEND**: This plugin can be used to use a wasm plugin as backend
  - **ROUTE_MATCHER**: This plugin can be used to use a wasm plugin as route matcher
  - **SINK**: Handle unmatched requests with a wasm plugin
  - **PRE_ROUTE**: This plugin can be used to use a wasm plugin as in pre-route phase

You can also create a Izanami plugin

```
wasmo init --name=my-first-plugin --language=js --product=izanami
```

For the moment, Izanami doesn't provide any templates.

If you want to start from scratch, without targeting any products

```
wasmo init --name=my-first-plugin --language=js
```

## Or selecting a template

You can now optionally start a new plugin from a template by appending `--template=[template-name]` to the creation command.

If you don't pass a template, Wasmo will list the available templates. There are listed by product : 
  - empty template : `js`, `ts`, `opa`, `go` and `rust`
  - Otoroshi template : `otoroshi_go`, `otoroshi_rust`, `otoroshi_opa`, `otoroshi_ts`, `otoroshi_js`
  - Izanami template : `izanami_js`, `izanami_go`, `izanami_rust`, `izanami_opa`, `izanami_ts`

```
wasmo init --name=my-first-plugin --template=[template-name] --path=[output-directory]
```

Running this command with any of theses templates will create a directory called `my-first-plugin` inside the specified output directory (or the current if omitted). Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure with the metadata file pre-filled with the name of your plugin.

## Creating a production WASM binary

`wasmo build` starts the process to build a WASM binary of your plugin. Inside the plugin directory will be your WASM binary and sources.

You have two ways to build your plugin:
  - locally with Docker
  - remotely by deploying a [Wasmo server][wasmoserver]

[wasmoserver]: https://github.com/MAIF/wasmo

Assuming we want to build our `my-first-plugin` locally. Enter the following command to start the build. 

```
wasmo build --host=OneShotDocker --path=my-first-plugin
```

Let's explain these 3 parameters:
  - the `path` parameter is explicitly used to indicate the plugin to build
  - the `host` indicates which kind of Wasmo server used. The pratical way is to use `Docker` or `OneShotDocker` because it prevents to install a Wasmo server by deploying, inside your locally Docker, a new Wasmo container. The last possible value is `Remote` and can be used to specify with a URI the remote Wasmo server used.
