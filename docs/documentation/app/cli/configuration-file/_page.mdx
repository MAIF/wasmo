# Configure your configuration file

```
wasmo config get
wasmo config reset
wasmo config set <key>=<value>
```
Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

## Description

wasmo gets its config from the command line, environment variables, `.wasmo` files, and in some cases, directly from the build command.

The `wasmo config` command can be used to update and edit the contents of the user and global wasmo files.

## Sub-commands

### set

```
wasmo config set <key>=<value>
```

Sets each of the config keys to the value provided.

If value is omitted, then it sets it to an empty string.

The available keys are: 
  - `path`: configure the path where the wasmo configuration will be stored
  - `server`: the Wasmo server to build your plugins (an URL format value is expected)
  - `clientId`: the client id used in Basic and Otoroshi Auth
  - `clientSecret`: the client secret used in Basic and Otoroshi Auth

You can also edit the configuration file manually. In this case, the following values are :
  - `path` = WASMO_PATH
  - `server` = WASMO_SERVER

### get 

```
wasmo config get
```

Show all the config settings.


### reset

```
wasmo config get
```

Reset the configuration file with the default settings. The custom user `.wasmo` files will not be deleted.
