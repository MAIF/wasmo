# Core commands

The `wasmo` CLI internally contains a number of subcommands for working
with wasm modules:

## wasmo config set <Badges values={['token', 'path', 'server']} />

Globally configure the CLI with the authorization token, the path where the configuration file will be stored and the server to reach during the build. These parameters are optional and can be passed when running the build command.  |

## wasmo config get 
Get the configuration from the configured path file or from `$HOME/.wasmo` |

## wasmo config reset        
Clean configuration and reset to default settings. The default file path configuration will be `$HOME/.wasmo`                                   ||

##  wasmo init <Badges values={['template', 'name', 'path']} />
Initialize a WASM plugin to the specific path. You can choose between many templates, javascript/typescript (js/ts), Open Policy Agent (opa), Rust or Golang (go). |

## wasmo build <Badges values={['path', 'host', 'server', 'token']} />
Build the plugin  by sending the contents to the remote or local Wasmo server. As soon as the build is complete, the WASM binary is donwloaded and saved in the plugin folder. |
