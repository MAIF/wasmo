# Wasmo

Wasmo is combined tool (Builder and CLI) for creating and building from scrach your WASM binaries with a simple Docker container.
WebAssembly (WASM) is a simple machine model and executable format with an extensive specification. It is designed to be portable, compact, and execute at or near native speeds.

Wasmo is strongly linked to [Extism](https://extism.org/) and all plugins built with Wasmo will be only executable with an Existm runtime.
