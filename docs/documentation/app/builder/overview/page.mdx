# What is Wasmo Builder ?

Wasmo Builder is an all-in-one builder for creating, editing and building **small** and **optimized** WASM binaries.

# Key Features

- `Variety of languages`: Write plugins in your favorite language, Javascript, Typescript, Rust, Golang or Open Policy Agent.
- `Build in one click`: Click the hammer and start using your wasm in seconds
- `Fast starter`: Deploy the builder in-memory

# Start your first builder

## Prerequisites

- `Docker`: A Docker-enabled system with proper Docker access

Choose a path to install Wasmo Builder:
- `With a database`: Use a database to store generated Wasm binaries. Can use the Builder API for editing plugins.
- `Without a database (in-memory)`: Store generated Wasm binaries on the file system. In this mode, the Builder API is unavailable but the CLI keeps running.

Run the following command in your terminal to start your builder using a S3 storage:

```
docker network create wasmo-network
docker run --name s3Server \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -e SCALITY_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access_key \
    -e SCALITY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret \
    --net wasmo-network scality/s3server
docker run -d --net wasmo-network \
    --name wasmo \
    -p 5001:5001 \
    -e "AUTH_MODE=NO_AUTH" \
    -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access_key" \
    -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret" \
    -e "S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true" \
    -e "S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000" \
    -e "S3_BUCKET=wasmo" \
    -e "STORAGE=DOCKER_S3" \
    maif/wasmo
```

If all goes well, Wasmo should now be serving your builder on [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/)
