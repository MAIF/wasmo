# Write your first plugin

## Prerequisites

A Wasmo Builder instance running. If not, you should read the [Getting started](/builder/getting-started) section.

## Create your first greeting plugin

1. [Navigate to Wasmo UI](http://localhost:5001)
2. From the plugins menu at the top left, click the Plus button.
3. Select `Javascript` language from the list
4. In the field that just appeared, add a `Name` for your plugin
5. Click and edit the `index.js` file

```javascript
function greet() {
    const name = Host.inputString()
    Host.outputString(`Hello, ${name}`)
}

module.exports = {greet}
```

Click the `hammer` icon at the top right of the screen to start the build process.
> During the process the logs and errors are displayed in the `terminal` view at the bottom.

Once completed, your plugin should appear in the `Releases` section in the left sidebar. 
You can click on the item in the list to automatically download the WASM file.

## Testing your first plugin

Wasmo binaries are strongly linked to [Extism](https://extism.org/) and this is why we have to run your WASM with their executable.
You can download the [Extism CLI](https://github.com/extism/cli/releases) on the releases page or using go with the following command.

```
go install github.com/extism/cli/extism@latest
```

Once downloaded, you can run the command by passing the function to call, the parameter to apply and the WASM file to execute.

```
extism call <your-plugin-file>.wasm greet \
    --input "Benjamin" \
    --wasi
```

If the command succeeds, you will see: `Hello, Benjamin`.

Congratulations, you have just created your first plugin!
