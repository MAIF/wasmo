# Collaborate

Wasmo 1.2.2 brings a new feature to collaborate inside the product. You can work together on a plugin by sharing it with collaborators. It's easy to share plugins with your entire team. 

1. In Wasmo, on the left, click Share plugin.
2. Email can be added to two lists : the first to allow users to edit, view and share plugin, and the second, more restrictive, where users can only
edit and view plugins.
3. Click Update authorized people

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', width: '100%', marginTop: '2rem' }}>
  <img src="/wasmo/collaborate.png" width={500} style={{ borderRadius: '.5rem' }} />
</div>
