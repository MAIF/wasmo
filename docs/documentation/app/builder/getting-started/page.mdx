# Getting started

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: A Docker-enabled system with proper Docker access

Choose a path to install Wasmo Builder:
- **With a database**: Use a database to store generated Wasm binaries. Can use the Builder UI for editing plugins.
- **Without a database (in-memory)**: Store generated Wasm binaries on the file system. In this mode, the Builder UI is unavailable but the CLI keeps running.

Run the following command in your terminal to start your builder using a S3 storage:

```
docker network create wasmo-network
docker run -d --name s3Server \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    -e SCALITY_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access_key \
    -e SCALITY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret \
    --net wasmo-network scality/s3server
docker run -d --net wasmo-network \
    --name wasmo \
    -p 5001:5001 \
    -e "AUTH_MODE=NO_AUTH" \
    -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=access_key" \
    -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secret" \
    -e "S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true" \
    -e "S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000" \
    -e "S3_BUCKET=wasmo" \
    -e "STORAGE=DOCKER_S3" \
    maif/wasmo
```

These commands will first create a custom Docker network, then instantiate a new S3 from the Scality imagte and run a Wasmo Builder connnected to the S3.
<br />
If all goes well, Wasmo should now be serving your builder on [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/).

If you are running Docker on MacOS, you should change `S3_ENDPOINT` to `http://host.docker.internal:8000`.
