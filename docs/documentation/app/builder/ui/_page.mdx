# User Interface

Wasmo Build comes with its own interface. The flow wasn design to be simple. 
It's about creating and editing plugins.

## Sidebar

The sidebar contains:

- the deployed version of your Wasmo Builder

- a button named `Plugins` to create a new plugin
- the sorted list of your plugins by language

When you have clicked on a plugin in the list, the sidebar changes to the `Plugin view`.

## Plugin View

The plugin view contains:

- a button named `Plugins` to create a new plugin

- a button named `Change current plugin` to get back the list of plugins
- the list of your plugin files (refer to [this section](/builder/plugin-structure) to learn about it)
- a button named `Remove <plugin>` to safely remove your current plugin

## Actions in the navigation bar

Ath the top right of the screen, you should notice four actions:

- `Save` icon to save your current edit on files

- `Hammer` icon to create a development version of your plugin
- `Rocket` icon to create a final version of your plugin
- `Download` icon to download the source code of your plugin

## Terminal

The terminal is a read-only view to get build logs during the building process.
