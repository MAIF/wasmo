# Environment variables

Wasmo Builder is fully configurable and the only way to configure it is to use the environment variables.

- [Storage](#storage)
- [Authentications](#authentications)
- [Pairing with Otoroshi](#pairing-with-otoroshi)
- [Using the CLI](#using-the-cli)
- [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)

## Storage <Badges values={['STOS3', 'DOCKER_S3', 'LOCAL']} raw />

Wasmo Builder can be run on three differents ways:

- `STORAGE=S3`: Use a remote S3 to store generated Wasm binaries. Can use the Builder UI for editing plugins.

- `STORAGE=DOCKER_S3`: Use a Docker remote S3 to store generated Wasm binaries. Can use the Builder UI for editing plugins.

Both `S3` and `DOCKER_S3` configuration must used the related variables :
```
# required
STORAGE=<S3|DOCKER_S3>
S3_ENDPOINT=<value should start with scheme>
S3_BUCKET=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<DEFAULT 'us-east-1'>

# optional
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=<DEFAULT false>
```

- `STORAGE=LOCAL`: Use the filesystem to store generated Wasm binaries. The Builder UI is not available with this storage type. You should use this
storage if you want to quickly start an instance and only use the Wasmo CLI. The `local` storage 
involves setting an interval to the cleanup job. The job removes binaries with outdated dates.

```
# required
STORAGE=LOCAL

# optional
LOCAL_WASM_JOB_CLEANING=<DEFAULT 60 * 60 * 1000> # 1 hour
```

## Authentications <Badges values={['AUTH_MODE']} raw />

Wasmo has one level of authentication. The value can be `AUTH` or `NO_AUTH`. 

`AUTH_MODE=AUTH`

This level of authentication should be used at least in production mode. It ensures that the Wasmo's UI and backend are only accessible with tokens.

`AUTH_MODE=NO_AUTH`

Wasmo is accessible without tokens or secrets. The UI is also available without any restrictions.

## Pairing with Otoroshi <Badges values={['OTOROSHI_TOKEN_SECRET', 'OTOROSHI_USER_HEADER', 'AUTH_MODE']} raw />

[Otoroshi](https://maif.github.io/otoroshi/manual/getting-started.html) is a layer of lightweight api management on top of a modern http reverse proxy written in Scala.

You have two ways to configure Wasmo and Otoroshi : 

- Wasmo is used by Otoroshi to pull compiled Wasm binaries

- Otoroshi exposes Wasmo UI by securing user access

In both cases, you need to configure Wasmo and Otoroshi with same values for the following variables.

```
# required
OTOROSHI_TOKEN_SECRET=
AUTH_MODE=NO_AUTH | AUTH_MODE

# optional
OTOROSHI_USER_HEADER=<DEFAULT 'otoroshi-user'>
```
 

## Using the CLI <Badges values={['CLI_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER', 'CLI_AUTHORIZATION']} raw />

Wasmo Builder can be called by its own UI or by a Wasmo CLI. To secure calls, Wasmo CLI must send some headers.
These values must be equal between Wasmo Builder and Wasmo CLI and will be used by Wasmo CLI when calling the builder.

``` Query
POST /build HTTP/1.1
...
<CLI_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER>: <CLI_AUTHORIZATION>
```

```
# required
CLI_AUTHORIZATION=

# optional
CLI_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER=<DEFAULT 'Authorization'>
```
