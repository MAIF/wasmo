# Integration with Otoroshi

We can connect Otoroshi with Wasmo. The only step is to navigate to the danger zone of your Otoroshi instance, 
and add the following values in the Wasmo section:

- `URL`: http://localhost:5001
- `Apikey id`: admin-api-apikey-id
- `Apikey secret`: admin-api-apikey-secret
- `User`: *
- `Token secret`:

The User property is used by Wasmo to filter the list of returned plugins. For example, 
if the value of the property is `wasm@otoroshi.io`, Wasmo will return the list of Wasm plugins with the creator at `wasm@otoroshi.io`.

Donâ€™t forget to save the configuration.
