### What is the fastest way to use Wasmo?

```
$ cargo install wasmo
or
$ brew tap maif/wasmo
$ brew install wasmo
```

### How to create an Otoroshi-compatible plugin using Docker? 
<Badge raw value="Name : foo" default/>

Initialize the plugin with corresponding Otoroshi template and Javascript language 
``` 
wasmo init --template=otoroshi_js --name=foo
```

Build plugin from folder and Docker
```
wasmo build --host=OneShotDocker --path=.
```

### How can I create a new development version of my plugin?
<Badges raw values={["Name : foo", "Version : 1.0.2"]} default/>

Rust plugin

``` Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "foo"
version = "1.0.2"

...
```

JS/TS/Open Policy Agent plugin

``` package.json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.2",
  ...
}
```

Go plugin

``` go.mod
module foo/1.0.2

...
```

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', width: '100%', marginTop: '2rem' }}>
  <img src="/wasmo/release.png" style={{  borderRadius: '.5rem',
    width: '230px',
    maxWidth: '230px',
    height: '503px',
    minHeight: '503px'
  }} />

  <div className="flex flex-col ms-5">
    ### Can I download the generated Wasm from the UI?

    Once you have built a dev or release version of your plugin using the Hammer or Rocker buttons (available at the top right of the screen),
    you can click on each version under the 'Releases' section on the left side of the screen.

    ### Can I determine who built each version and at what time?

    Each plugin has a **config** file under the **configuration** section with the following information : 
      - type: language used to develop the plugin.
      - users: list of users allowed to edit and view the plugin.
      - admins: list of admins allowed to edit, view and share the plugin.
      - filename: name of the plugin.
      - pluginId: unique ID of the plugin.
      - template: original template, selected at plugin creation.
      - **versions: list of built versions, with name, creator and date of generation**.
      - last_hash: hash used by the backend to check if changes has been made between last version.
  </div>
</div>

### How can I collaborate with my team?

Since version 1.22, Wasmo allows users to share plugins with two levels of rights: 
- `users`: Can edit and view plugin.
- `admins`: Can edit, view and share plugin.

You can find more information about sharing by reading this [article](/wasmo/builder/collaborate)

### Our team have a CI/CD process and wants to automate the building of our plugins.

Since version 1.x, Wasmo includes a command line interface to create, edit and build plugins. 

You can find more [information](/wasmo/cli/getting-started) about the CLI and the Github [repository](https://github.com/MAIF/wasmo/tree/main/cli)
